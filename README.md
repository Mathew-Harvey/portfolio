## Deployed Application

## Description 🧐
I've designed a clean, minimal and intuative interface to showcase my projects, professional achievements and contact informations. This application was designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. The styling was completed using the Bulma CSS framework, keeping the design simple and easy to follow.
## Motivation 🚀
I have always been taken by nice UI design, particularly on my phone. Prefering to run android devices that let me mod and customise my UI. I took inspiration from this when puttin together this portfolio. 
## Installation 🛠️
Visit the hosted application and click on things :D
## Usage 🏃‍♀️
Fork or download the code. Edit the html, css files. The JS file controls the 'about me' overlay only.
