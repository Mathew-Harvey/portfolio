# Mat's Portfolio
I've designed a clean, minimal and intuative interface to showcase my projects, professional achievements and contact informations
<br />
This application was designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
<br />
<p>
The styling was completed using the Bulma CSS framework, keeping the design simple and easy to follow.
